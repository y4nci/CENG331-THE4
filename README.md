# CENG331-THE4

## description

this repo includes my solutions for the performance lab, the 4th assignment, of ceng331 - computer organisation course in metu. all my solutions are in `kernel.c`

# IMPORTANT NOTES

in every commit, the latest performance is recorded in the form of (x, y) where x is the `avgpool` performance and y is the `convolution` performance.
these performances are recorded on random inputs and are subject to change as a result. **THE FILES ARE COMMITTED WITH THEIR PERFORMANCES AFTER 5 TESTS.**
the average of those 5 tests are recorded in the commits.

## regulations

 - **for `avgpool` solution**, the performance should be above 2.2, that is enough for it.
 - **for `convolution`**, the higher is the better and the limit is the sky. the targeted performance is **>= 5** tho
